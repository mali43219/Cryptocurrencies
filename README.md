# Cryptocurrencies


The goal of this task is to assist clients who are preparing to invest in cryptocurrency. To achieve this, we will perform unsupervised learning to group the different cryptocurrencies and create a classification system for the new investment portfolio. 

The assignment is divided into four technical analysis parts:

1. Preprocessing the Data for PCA: In this step, we will use the Pandas library to preprocess the dataset to be able to perform PCA.

2. Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA: We will then apply the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm to reduce the dimensions of the dataset to three principal components. These components will be placed in a new DataFrame.

3. Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means: Using hvPlot, we will create an elbow curve to determine the best value for K from the reduced dataset. Then, we will run the K-means algorithm to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrencies' data.

4. Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results: Finally, we will utilize data visualization to present the findings to the clients.
